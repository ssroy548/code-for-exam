(Sales Commission Calculator) A large company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. 
The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. 
For example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of merchandise in a week receives $200
 plus 9% of $5000, or a total of $650. You’ve been supplied with a list of the items sold 
by each salesperson. The values of these items are as follows:
Item     Value
1           239.99
2           129.75
3           99.95
4         350.89
Write a program that inputs one salesperson’s items sold for last week and calculates and 
displays that salesperson’s earnings. There’s no limit to the number of items that can be 
sold.





Solution:








import java.util.Scanner;
class arif1{
	float a;
	int n;
	public void salespeople(){
		Scanner input =new Scanner (System.in);
		float sum = 0;
		System.out.println("How many product you want to sold ? :");
n=input.nextInt();
float a[]=new float[50];
		System.out.println("Enter prices of thats products: ");
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
			a[i]=input.nextFloat();
			
		
			
			
		}
		System.out.println("Total prices are: ");
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
			sum=sum+a[i];
			
			
		}
		
		System.out.println(sum);
		float account;
	account=((sum*9)/100)+200;
	System.out.println("Earnings of this weak is "+"$" +account);
	
	}
	
	
	
}
public class no6 {
	public static void main(String arg[]){
		arif1 oikoi=new arif1();
		oikoi.salespeople();
	}

}
