(Find the Largest Number) The process of finding the largest value is used frequently
 in computer applications. For example, a program that determines the winner of a sales 
contest would input the number of units sold by each salesperson. The salesperson who sells the most units wins the contest.
Write a program that inputs a series of 10 integers and determines and prints the largest 
integer. Your program should use at least the following three variables:
a) counter: A counter to count to 10 (i.e., to keep track of how many numbers have been
 input and to determine when all 10 numbers have been processed).
b) number: The integer most recently input by the user.
c) largest: The largest number found so far.



solution:




import java.util.Scanner;
class arif1{
	int n;
	float a,b;
	public void largest(){
		Scanner input =new Scanner (System.in);
		System.out.println("How many number you want to enter: ");
		float b[]=new float[50];
		n=input.nextInt();
		System.out.println("Numbers are :");
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
			b[i]=input.nextFloat();
			
			}
		for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++)

		{

		for(int j=0;j<n-1;j++)

		{

		if(b[j]>b[j+1])

		{

		float temp;

		temp= b[j];

		b[j]=b[j+1];

		b[j+1]=temp;

		}

		}

		}

		 

		System.out.print("largest value is :");

        System.out.print(" "+b[n-1]);

		 }
		
	}
	
	
public class no07 {
public static void main(String arg[]){
	arif1  a=new arif1();
	a.largest();
	
}
}
